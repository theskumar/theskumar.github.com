Hi! I'm Saurabh, a full-stack engineering leader who's spent 13+ years solving
complex technical challenges for startups and enterprises including The Montley
Fool, Tony Robbins and NationsBenefits. My expertise spans Golang, Python, and
Node.js‚Äîboth writing code and leading teams of up to 14 engineers.

Outside work, I cherish time with my family on the outskirts of Delhi, where my
wife, son, and our dog [Hachi] keep me grounded üê∂.

Currently available for new contracting opportunities and agency partnerships.
Let's connect to discuss how my technical and leadership experience can benefit
your organization.

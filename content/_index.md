Greetings! I'm Saurabh, a seasoned full-stack developer with over 13 years of experience crafting digital solutions that prioritize meaningful, calm, and user-centered experiences. I currently serve as the Director of Engineering, Web Services at Fueled.

I currently reside on the peaceful outskirts of Delhi with my family—my wife, son, and our beloved dog Hachi 🐶.
